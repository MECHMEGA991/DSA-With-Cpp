🌳 What is a Tree?

A Tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure made up of nodes connected by edges.

✔It has:

A root node → topmost node
Parent and child nodes
Leaf nodes → nodes with no children
Subtrees → smaller trees inside a tree

✔Properties:

There is only one path between any two nodes
No cycles
Used to represent hierarchical structures.

✔Real-world examples:

File Explorer

Family Tree

Organization Chart

HTML DOM

🌳 What is a Binary Tree?

A Binary Tree is a special type of tree where each node has at most 2 children.
Children are named:

Left child

Right child

🌳 Types of Binary Trees

Below are the most important types:

1️⃣ Full Binary Tree (Proper / Strict)

Every node has 0 or 2 children.
No node has only one child.

      1
     / \
    2   3

2️⃣ Complete Binary Tree

All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level,
and nodes in the last level are filled from left to right.

Used in:

Heaps

Priority Queues

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5

3️⃣ Perfect Binary Tree

A tree where:

All internal nodes have 2 children
All leaf nodes are at the same level

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4  5 6  7

4️⃣ Balanced Binary Tree

A tree where the height difference between left and right subtree is ≤ 1.

Used in:
AVL Tree
Red-Black Tree

Guarantees:

O(log n) search, insert, delete

5️⃣ Degenerate (Skewed) Binary Tree

Each node has only one child.
Equivalent to a linked list.

Left-skewed:
1
 \
  2
   \
    3

Right-skewed:
1
 \
  2
   \
    3

6️⃣ Binary Search Tree (BST)

A special binary tree with property:

Left child < Parent
Right child > Parent

Enables:

Fast searching (like binary search)

Time complexity:

Best: O(log n)

Worst (skewed): O(n)

7️⃣ AVL Tree

A self-balancing BST.
Keeps height-balanced by rotations.

Guarantee:

Search, insert, delete: O(log n)

8️⃣ Red-Black Tree

Another self-balancing BST used in:

C++ STL map
Java TreeMap
Linux kernel

Guarantees:

Worst-case height: O(log n)

🌳 Summary Table (Easy for Interviews)

Tree Type	Description

Full Binary Tree	0 or 2 children
Complete Binary Tree	Last level filled left to right
Perfect Binary Tree	All leaves at same level & full
BST	Left < root < right
AVL Tree	Height-balanced BST
Red-Black Tree	Balanced using color rules
Skewed Tree	Looks like a linked list
