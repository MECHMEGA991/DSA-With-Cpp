1. Definition

A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes).

Formally: G = (V, E)

V = set of vertices

E = set of edges


2. Types of Graphs

Type	                                                        Description                                        	Example
Directed Graph (Digraph)	                    Edges have direction (u → v)	                                Twitter following
Undirected Graph	                            Edges have no direction	                                        Facebook friendship
Weighted Graph	                                Edges carry weights	                                            Road distances
Unweighted Graph	                            No weight on edges	                                            Social network links
Cyclic / Acyclic	                            Contains / doesn’t contain cycles	                            Task scheduling (DAG)
Connected / Disconnected	                    All vertices reachable / not	                                Network nodes
Bipartite Graph	Vertices                        can be divided into 2 sets with edges only between sets	        Job assignment


3. Graph Representations

a) Adjacency Matrix

2D array matrix[V][V]

matrix[i][j] = 1 if edge exists, else 0

Pros: Easy to check if edge exists

Cons: Space O(V²), slow for sparse graphs

b) Adjacency List

Array of lists list[V]

list[i] stores all neighbors of vertex i

Pros: Efficient for sparse graphs

Space O(V + E)
